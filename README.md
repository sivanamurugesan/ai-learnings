# ü§ñ Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI

Learn **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI** from scratch with **hands-on tutorials** and **enterprise-grade use-cases**. This repository guides you through the foundations of AI on RHEL and shows how to build, deploy, and optimize real-world AI models in hybrid cloud environments using Red Hat technologies.

## üìö Basic AI Terminologies

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. |
| **Machine Learning (ML)** | A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. |
| **Deep Learning** | A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex data patterns. |
| **Neural Network** | A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | A field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. |
| **Computer Vision** | Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data like images or videos. |
| **Generative AI** | AI systems that can create new content, such as text, images, or music, based on learned patterns. |
| **Cloud AI** | AI services and tools provided through cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift AI. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for flexibility and scalability. |
| **Inference** | Using a trained AI model to make predictions or decisions based on new data. |

# AI Terminologies with Analogies

| **Term**                     | **Definition**                                                                                     | **Analogy**                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn.            | Like teaching a robot to act like a human ‚Äî it can think, plan, and make decisions like a smart pet.     |
| **Machine Learning (ML)**       | A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. | Like training a child to recognize animals by showing pictures ‚Äî the more examples, the better they get. |
| **Deep Learning**              | A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex data patterns.        | Like layers of filters in photo editing ‚Äî each layer refines and adds detail to the final image.         |
| **Neural Network**             | A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). | Like a network of pipes passing water (data) from one junction (neuron) to another, adjusting flow.       |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | A field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. | Like teaching a foreigner to speak your language and understand emotions in tone and words.              |
| **Computer Vision**            | Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data like images or videos.      | Like giving sight to a robot ‚Äî now it can "see" and recognize faces, cars, or objects like a human does. |
| **Generative AI**              | AI systems that can create new content, such as text, images, or music, based on learned patterns. | Like an artist who learns thousands of styles and then creates original artwork from imagination.         |
| **Cloud AI**                   | AI services and tools provided through cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift AI. | Like renting a powerful AI brain from the internet instead of building and maintaining your own.         |
| **Hybrid Cloud**               | Combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for flexibility and scalability.          | Like keeping valuables at home while renting extra space elsewhere ‚Äî best of both worlds.                |
| **Inference**                  | Using a trained AI model to make predictions or decisions based on new data.                     | Like a doctor making a diagnosis based on past experience ‚Äî the AI is applying what it has learned.      |
